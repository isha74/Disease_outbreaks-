# 🏥 Disease Prediction System
This project utilizes Machine Learning to analyze historical health data and predict whether a person has Diabetes, Heart Disease, or Parkinson’s Disease based on user input. The system is built using Streamlit for the frontend and ML models for prediction.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 
Streamlit (for UI)
Scikit-learn (for model training)
Pandas & NumPy (for data processing)
Pickle (for model storage)

##⚡ Features
✔ Predicts Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease
✔ User-friendly Streamlit interface
✔ Models trained on real-world datasets
✔ Fast and accurate results

## 🚀 How to Run

1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/isha74/Disease_outbreaks-
cd disease-prediction

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Run the Application
streamlit run web.py
4️⃣ Enter the required details and get predictions! 🎯

## 📊 How It Works
1. User inputs health parameters
2. Pre-trained ML models process the data
3. Prediction is displayed on the UI
